# sc_ssl_support
# Script Tested using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server.   

#USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!   
#This script is a WORK AROUND to fixing this issue by using NGINX as a reverse proxy rather then using SC's Mono.
#THERE MIGHT BE BUGS IN THIS SCRIPT!
#This is an attempt to try to make it easier for the people that have no idea what they are doing.
#This assumes your using a debian/ubuntu based OS, and probably more ubuntu then debian.
#This assumes your default install path is /opt/screenconnect/  
#This assumes your going to use letsencrypt for a free ssl certificate
#When the script asks you for hostname you should input the exact hostname your using for your screenconnect on prem 
#i.e.      help.mydomain.com 

#make script executable 
chmod +x  sc_ssl_script_v2



# run the script
./sc_ssl_script_v2
